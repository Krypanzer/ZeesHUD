# About
ZeesHUD is a TF2 custom HUD made by TF2 Community member and YTuber, Zeesastrous (or Zeesa, for short.) The HUD itself is unlike any other HUD that can be found in HUD.TF at the time, instead of minimalist features that typically found in other custom HUDs, ZeesHUD was more focussed on bringing style and asthetic into its presentation, making the HUD look more pretty without being too distracting. I tried it myself, and I fell in love with how stylish and full of life it is. And I still use it today over all of the custom HUDs there are in HUDs.TF.

This fork is dedicated to the hard work that Zessa has made to make a HUD that was vastly different from the others and I hope I can be of service if any parts of the HUD breaks.
